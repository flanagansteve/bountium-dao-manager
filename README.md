Bountium is a platform for autonomous commerce, in which one can deploy a smart contract to represent their business, release products from that business, and assign incentiviser markets for each step in the supply chain of that product. When the business receives orders, it will automatically place bounties out to each supply step's incentiviser, allowing orders to automatically get placed through to suppliers. Furthermore, suppliers won't get paid until the incentiviser contract managing that supply step is satisfied, allowing for far more quality-assured production.

Completed Features:
1. Smart contracts to represent a business, to assess a supply step, and to establish an incentiviser market for a supply step that depends on the assessor's input
2. A front-end allowing people to create businesses, manage businesses, release products, order products, and fulfill supply requests (at incentiviser markets) generated by orders.

Planned Features:
1. Styling
2. A registrar of incentiviser markets that will allow suppliers to easily discover work, and to help suggesst autobiz owners with applicable incentivisers for their products
3. A feed of incomplete bounties for suppliers
4. Gas optimisation via IPFS data storage
5. Page to manually post requests to an Incentiviser; this makes supply chains manual rather than automatic, but allows individuals or businesses that don't want to list shares as a smart contract to employ the market of suppliers present on an incentiviser
6. Profiles for suppliers/customers so they can see past bounties/orders respectively
7. Chat between a customer and an autobiz
8. Chat between an autobiz and a supplier attempting to complete their supply request
9. Auto-generated JS snippets that will allow you to list Bountium-powered products on traditional e-commerce sites
10. Search for products by keyword for customers
11. Exploring stateless functions for further gas optimisation

... and lots of other stuff!
